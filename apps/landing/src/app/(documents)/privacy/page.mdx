## Your Data is Yours

At Metrik, we care about your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding your information.

## What information do we collect?

### For all customers

When you sign up for a Metrik trial or plan through our Roblox OAuth2 login integration, we collect some limited crucial information relating to your Roblox account. By signing up, you agree to our collection and use of this information.

- #### Roblox User ID

  When you successfully sign into Metrik for the first time through Roblox, we collect your Roblox User ID and associate it with your user account. We use this to form a connection between your Roblox account and your Metrik account. Additionally, we maintain a blocklist of Roblox User IDs that are not allowed to use Metrik due to violations of our Terms of Service.

- #### Roblox account creation date

  During your first login into Metrik, we check the creation date of your Roblox account to ensure that it is at least 30 days old. This is to prevent abuse of our systems by bots and spam accounts. We do not store your Roblox account creation date.

- #### Roblox username & avatar

  We store your Roblox username & avatar to allow you to easily identify your account, and to let our staff identify your account in the event of a support request.

- #### Device fingerprint & IP address

  We collect a device fingerprint and your IP address to identify your device. We then cross reference the two values and your Metrik User ID with our database to find matches, and merge them into a single record representing possible User IDs, fingerprints and IP addresses that could be associated. This allows us to effectively combat alternate and spam accounts. This data is only used to prevent abuse of our systems and is not shared with any third parties.

### For customers who have subscribed to a paid plan

If you decide to subscribe to Metrik past your trial period, you will exchange billing information with Stripe, our subscription management subprocessor. All billing details remain stored on Stripe's own servers. The data may pass through our servers to display brief subscription details on the Metrik dashboard, however our servers will never store your billing information. You can read more about Stripe's security & privacy measures [here](https://stripe.com/privacy).

### For players of a game that uses Metrik

We collect very limited information about the individual end-users of our customers, and for the sole purpose of providing access to a game server's details to the game developer. **Once the server you are playing in is stopped or you leave, this data is deleted.**

- #### Roblox User ID

  We collect your Roblox User ID to let the game developer know who is in each server of their game, which can help with moderation and troubleshooting.

- #### Roblox username & avatar

  We store your Roblox username & avatar to allow the game developer to easily identify your account in the player list.

## How do we use your information?

We use your information solely to provide and improve the services we offer to you. We don't share your data with anyone except for our subprocessors. We have provided several helpful links to their applicable policies as well.
